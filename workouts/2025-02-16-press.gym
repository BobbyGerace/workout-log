// Normally I would have done different assistance exercises,
// but I feel beat up and my elbows are barking, so I'm finishing
// with bodyweight stuff today. Next time I'll do more.

// post-workout addendum: Honestly this was a pretty good workout as-is. Might keep this
// and just up the reps and/or sets
